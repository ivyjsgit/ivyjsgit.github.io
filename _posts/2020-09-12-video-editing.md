Most of my exciting work this week was recording and editing the tutorial video for My Life In Months. I did **not** expect how long this would take, from all of the script edits and redubbing that I had to do. 

When I sat down to record the video, I expected to record the project in one take, and then trim down the unnecessary pauses

What I expected to look like this:

Actually looks like this!

![Actual timeline]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/media/my-life-in-months-timeline.png)

This is because I had to redub a majority of the original video because when I get anxious, I tend to stutter and mess up words. 

Through the magic of post production, I was able to come up with a product I was happy with. 
 
While reviewing the rendered video footage, I realized that I had forgotten that MacOS includes thumbnails of documents in the downloads folder. Because some of these documents included my address and other information I had to go back and block them out. 

I tried using the blur tool, but I believe this was more for use with 3D moving objects, since it was trying to track objects, and I didn't have any luck using it. 

Eventually, I had to settle on an overly complicated method on using nodes that looks like this

This ended up dropping my framerate to from 60 FPS to **4 FPS** during playback for some reason. 

When I finally finished editing the video, I rendered it under the "YouTube" export settings. However, when I did this, I was not able to open the video file on other devices.

This was all fixed when I actually uploaded it to YouTube though. 

Here's the video:
