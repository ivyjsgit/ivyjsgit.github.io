**Wow, what can I say about this summer?**

Part of it felt like "summer break" never happened, but at the same time, it felt like it moved at a glacial pace because of how each day blended into one another. One simply **existed**, and not much else. 

On the other hand, I'm excited to be back at school (despite it being online) because it means I finally have something to do in order to break up the monotony of waking up, doing things until it is time to go to bed, and sleeping, rinse and repeat. 

In [Disco Tray Studios](discotraystudios.github.io), I'm excited to explore mobile development, as I have previously explored some Swift and iOS development in High School, but I haven't delved too far into it.

So far, Javascript and front-end development leave me scratching my head sometimes, but I am excited for things to come.
