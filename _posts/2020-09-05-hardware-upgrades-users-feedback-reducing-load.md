This week, I have made progress in trimming down the my-life-in-months chart library down to the core necessities so that it can be used by other people. In the future, I think it would be a good idea to create a seperate repository for this file and create a package.json file for it so that people can use it with a package manager like NPM.

On Wednesday, I have received hardware upgrades that have allowed me screenshare the website while in a Teams meeting without constant stuttering like I was previously having while trying to run multiple programs.
 
When attempting to collect sample charts from friends and family, I have received feedback from a user that stated that they did not understand how to use the website. This gave me an idea of creating a tutorial of how to use the website. I added the video player on my need-help branch, but currently it just plays a placeholder video.

I have written a script for the tutorial, but I am waiting for changes to settle down before actually recording it and uploading it to the site. Because of my recent hardware upgrades, I do not think I will have an issue with the recording or editing. 

Here's a short test recording. It was recorded at 1440p60, but for some reason YouTube only shows 1080p60.
