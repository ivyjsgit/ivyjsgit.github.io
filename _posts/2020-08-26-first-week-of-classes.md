The first week of classes has came and gone and My Life In Months is coming along nicely. On Friday, there was planned network maintenance that was supposed to last from 5 PM to 8 PM but has lasted from 7 PM and is still affecting login to the Hendrix Student network.

I didn't expect Teams to be **this** computationally intensive, and I am expecting to get a new laptop soon. Currently, I am unable to pull up the webpages that I am working on when I am in a meeting, and I expect that it will be a great help.

Now that I've looked into limitations of Github Pages, I'm not as worried about getting an angry email from Github about traffic/bandwidth usage, since I know that is an issue with a lot of smaller sites on [r/InternetIsBeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/).

For housekeeping purposes, I think it would be a good idea to remove some of the code that we don't use, such as the Table2CSV, and use CDNs when they are available.
