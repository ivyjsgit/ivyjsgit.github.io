It is officially spring! No more freezing when I get out of bed due to the 0ÂºC weather!

Because this is my senior year, spring is more than just flowers blooming and nice weather. For me, it means perfecting my resume and applying for jobs so that I will be prepared for when graduation rolls around.

After graduation, I wish to move to the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon maybe?) and become a developer. It will be a big move, but I am excited to make it and to see new places.
