This week I streamed Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo! It is a point and click adventure game developed by Humongous Entertainment directed towards young children (3-8 years old) in which the player takes control of an anthropomorphic car named Putt-Putt and solve puzzles in order to save zoo animals. 

By scattering required items and goals throughout the map, the player is required to use critical thinking skills in order to find each required item and use them in the proper location. 

For instance, while visiting Articland for the first time an avalanche will occur which prevents the player from progressing further through the area until a tool is found. In order to continue, the player must find a shovel in the Grasslands area and recognize that the shovel can be used to clear the fallen snow in the Artic area.

In order to prevent player frustration about "why isn't this item that I'm clicking pick up or do anything", nearly every object in PPStZ and other Humongous Entertainment games provides direct feedback through a unique animation and sound effect.

Additionally, the game may teach young players several facts about animals that they may not know such as that snakes are not very active in cold climates.
