This week I streamed Portal, a puzzle-platformer game by Valve Software. In this game, the player must control a character named Chel to transverse a number of Aperture Science testing chambers with the use of a portal gun that can create portals.

Within a school setting, there are connections to be made with momentum because momentum is conserved when passing through portals, and it is a required skill in the completion of some levels.

Portal can also be used as a team exercise that builds upon communication skills, designing instructions, and teamwork. 

As a part of the classroom, one student will be assigned as the "driver" and will be given the controls of the game. However, the driver is not to simply *play* the game by themselves. The other team members must work together to come to a solution to the puzzle and relay the solution to the driver in order to complete the puzzle. Team members can take turns being the driver.

I had several issues streaming the game (OBS pinned my computer at 100% GPU and was dropping frames), but I will try Twitch Studio next time.
