### Deployment

Adding authentication has greatly complicated the deployment process, and has created a learning curve for deploying the website. Instead of simply deploying the website, one must now create a seperate Authentication Application using the proper redirect URLs for deployment, load the keys into the environmental variables on the server, and then deploy. 

While exploring authentication and ways to differentiate teachers from students from people in the Office of Assessment, I explored Active Directory and the various types of groups and structures.

### Time Management

During this time, my senior seminar project has taken over my life, and I have ended up spending more time on it than I have on more important things because I was so into what I was doing and I also felt like I needed to work hard on it or I wouldn't complete it. Besides this, is important to maintain a healthy work-life balance. If you can't do this, the project is worthless and you will be burnt out from the project. 

Because of this, I decided to take a temporary break from the project and catch up on other classwork and get some much needed rest and relaxation.
